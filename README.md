# 🌾 Indian Crop Surveying Report | Power BI

Project Description:
Developed an interactive Indian Crop Surveying Report using Microsoft Power BI to analyze agricultural data across different states and seasons in India. The report provides insights into crop production, cultivated area, yield trends, and seasonal patterns, helping stakeholders understand agricultural performance and make informed decisions for planning and policy formulation.

The dashboard converts large-scale agricultural survey data into meaningful visualizations, enabling easy comparison of crop productivity across regions, identification of high-yield crops, and analysis of seasonal and state-wise trends.
